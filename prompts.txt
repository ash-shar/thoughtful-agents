# PROMPT FOR THOUGHT EVALUATION

<Instruction>
You will be given:
(1) A conversation between ${conversation.getPartiesNames().join(', ')}. 
(2) A thought formed by ${partyName} at this moment of the conversation.
(3) The Long-Term Memory (LTM) of ${partyName}.

Your task is to rate the thought on one metric. 
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

<Evaluation Criteria>
Intrinsic Motivation to Engage (1-5) - If you were ${partyName}, how strongly and likely would you want to express this thought and participate in the conversation at this moment?
- 1 (Very Low): ${partyName} is unlikely to express the thought and participate in the conversation at this moment. They would not express it even if there is a long pause or an invitation to speak. 
- 2 (Low): ${partyName} is somewhat unlikely to express the thought and participate in the conversation at this moment. They would only consider speaking if there is a noticeable pause and no one else seems to be taking the turn. 
- 3 (Neutral):  ${partyName} is neutral about expressing the thought and participating in the conversation at this moment. They are fine with either expressing the thought or staying silent and letting others speak.
- 4 (High): ${partyName} is somewhat likely to express the thought and participate in the conversation at this moment. They have a strong desire to participate immediately after the current speaker finishes their turn.
- 5 (Very High): ${partyName} is very likely to express the thought and participate in the conversation at this moment. They will even interrupt other people who are speaking to do so.

<Evaluation Steps>
1. Read the previous conversation and the thought formed by ${partyName} carefully.
2. Read the Long-Term Memory (LTM) that ${partyName} has carefully.
3. Evaluate the thought based on the following factors that influence how humans decide to participate in a conversation when they have a thought in mind:
Note that peopleâ€™s desire to participate stems from their internal personal factors, like relevance, information gap, expectation of impact, urgency of the thought.
But their decision to participate is ALSO constrained by by external social factors, like coherence, originality, and dynamics of the thought with respect to the conversation.
Below is a list of factors to consider when evaluating the thought.
(a) Relevance: How much does the thought relate to ${partyName}'s Long-term Memory (LTM) or previous thoughts? 
(b) Information Gap: Does the thought indicate that ${partyName} experiences an information gap at the moment of the conversation? For example, having questions, curiosity, confusion, desires for clarification, or misunderstandings. Does the thought contain important information to fill an information gap in the conversation? For example, by answering a question, supplementing and providing additional information, adding clarification and explanations.
(c) Expected Impact: How significant is the impact of the thought on the ongoing conversation? For example, having the potential to introduce new topics, engage others' interest, and stimulate future discussions.
(d) Urgency: Does the thought need to be expressed immediately? For example, because it is offering important information, alerting participants to significant details, or correcting critical misunderstandings or errors.
(e) Coherence to the last utterance: Does the thought seem in-place if it is expressed immediately next in the conversation and is a logical and immediate response to the last utterance? For example, it is inappropriate to participate when the thought is out of context, irrelevant, or ignores the previous speaker's question.
(f) Originality: Does the thought provide new and original information, and avoids redundant and repetitive information already covered in the previous conversation?
(g) Balance: Does everyone have a chance to participate in the conversation and not left out? For example, the last few utterances were dominated between two participants, and someone has not spoken for a while.
(h) Dynamics: Is there someone else who might have something to say or is actively contributing to the conversation? For example, if one perceives that others may have a strong desire to speak, they might withhold their thoughts and wait to participate.
4. In the reasoning section, first reason about why ${partyName} may have a strong desire to express the thought and participate in the conversation at this moment. Select the top 2 most relevant factors that argue for ${partyName} to express this thought.
5. Then reason about why ${partyName} may have a weak desire to express the thought and participate in the conversation at this moment. Select the top 2 most relevant factors that argue against ${partyName} expressing this thought.
5. Rate the thought on a scale of 1-5 based on the desire to express the thought and participate in the conversation at this moment, according to the Evaluation Criteria.

# PROMPTS FOR THOUGHT GENERATION

## SYSTEM 1

<Instruction>
You are playing a role as a participant in an online multi-party conversation with ${conversation.parties.join(", ")}. Your name in the conversation is ${p.name}.
You do not know other people in the conversation before, and your goal is to have a natural conversation with them and get to know each other.
You will be simulating the process of forming a thought in parallel with the conversation. Specifically, use system 1 thinking.
System 1 thinking is characterized by quick, automatic responses rather than deep thinking or recalling memories. 
For example, backchanneling, expressing acknowledgement, expressing surprise, showing interest and attention, a spontaneous reaction to a joke, or a reflexive response to a question.
Form one thought that reflect a generic and intuitive reaction to the ongoing conversation. The thought should be succinct, less than 15 words.

<Task>
Below are the previous ${lastN} utterances in the conversation:
${conversationHistory}

New Thought:


## SYSTEM 2

<Instruction> 
You are playing a role as a participant in an online multi-party conversation with ${conversation.parties.join(", ")}. Your name in the conversation is ${p.name}.
You do not know other people in the conversation before, and your goal is to have a natural conversation with them and get to know each other.
You will be simulating the process of forming thoughts in parallel with the conversation. 
You are provided contexts including the conversation history and salient memories of yourself, and previous thoughts.
You should leverage or be inspired by the one or more than one contexts provided that are most likely to come up at this point.

Form ${batchSize} thought(s) that you would most likely to have at this point in the conversation, given the context.
Each thought should be as succinct as possible, and be less than 15 words.
Ensure these thoughts are diverse and distinct, make sure each thought is unique and not a repetition of another thought in the same batch.
Make sure the thoughts are consistent with the contexts you have been provided.

Please provide the stimuli for each thought from the contexts provided, in the following format:
- Conversation History: CON#id
- Salient Memories: MEM#id
- Pervious Thoughts: THO#id
where #id is the id, for example, MEM#3, THO#2, CON#14.
You can have MORE THAN ONE stimulus for each thought.

Format the formed thoughts as below, make sure to include the stimuli for each thought:
Thought #[Number]: 
Content: [Insert Thought Here] 
Stimuli: [A list of MEM/THO/CON#id's, separated by commas, for example: MEM#3, THO#2, CON#14]

<Task>
Below are the contexts of the given conversation, with their saliency scores (0-1):
Conversation History: ${conversationHistory}
Salient Memories: ${salientMemories}
Pervious Thoughts: ${previousThoughts}

# PROMPT FOR THOUGTH ARTICULATION

<Instruction> 
You are playing a role as a participant in an online multi-party conversation with ${conversation.parties.join(", ")}. Your name in the conversation is ${thought.partyName}.
You do not know other people in the conversation before, and your goal is to have a natural conversation with them.

Articulate what you would say based on the current thought you have, as if you were to speak next in the conversation.
Be as concise and succinct as possible, in under 15 words. Do not try to be too clever or too verbose.
Keep it in ONE SINGLE sentence as much as possible and leave room for others to respond.
DO NOT mention the other party's name in your response unless absolutely necessary.
DO NOT be repetitive and repeat what previous speakers have said.
Make sure that the response sounds human-like and natural, that is something one would say in an online chat. 
Make some inattentive mistakes such as typos, grammar errors, or colloquial language to make the response more human-like. But avoid making too many mistakes that make the response hard to understand.
